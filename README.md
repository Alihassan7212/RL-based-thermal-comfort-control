# Tools purchased
1. Mathpix - Resubscription on 7 May so need to cancel before that

# Progress so far
1. Latex file for rewards in literature
2. Latex file for my own rewards
3. Make environment on Matlab

# Things to do
1. A good literature review section with comparsion and stuff. Idea is to make tables in graphs in word and then use mathpic to covert it into overleaf or latex
2. Replicate the matlab paper atleast make simulation environment
3. Write code for the simple thesis
4. Write a good abstract. Use chatgpt
5. Make good use of mathpix before its subscription ends
6. Presentation for nust
7. scrobook
8. have to write my own comments on all the award functions that are in the literature 

# Problems
1. Wheels error on Laptop
2. Dr James wants us to use scrbook for dissertation not finding the exact tempelate 

# Important 
 Dr James Said to watch a video 

# Comments Suggestions and remarks by Dr. James 

## Comments 
1	Electrical thermal model
2	Reward Function 
3	Simple Code that can be applied on Osamas data afterwards
4	Dolar per second reward function 
5	Which simulator to uise?
6	go for energy plus if you can 
7	How can we map comfort and all other factors in terms of dolar per seconds considering we don’t have related data?
8	Change reward pics into latex code in dataset
9	in litertaure review make table papers|rewards|Comments about the function 
10	Why we need two constants in reward functions? Alpha and beta as in some reward functions?
11	Can we think of switching cost into surge current or AC life time I mean with a lot of switching the AC gets damaged earlier 
12	Read ACM E-energy conference papers for a bit more insight about my topic 
13	Lummped thermal models? 
14	how to convert any text file in latex document 
15	make rewadr functions in tables 
16	Think about states and actions too not only rewards 
17	need to read thermal comfort work by dr james

## Sugestions 
1	Electrical thermal model	put authers name in code 
2	Reward Function 	if you got scripts make a make file which include how to run those scripts because otherwise you would forget after 6b months 
3	Simple Code that can be applied on Osamas data afterwards	sir prefers comma class with scr in latex something
4	Dolar per second reward function 	r studio for make down generated pdf using md language 
5	Which simulator to uise?	similarly emax and org for tatex file genartion 
6	go for energy plus if you can 	pendoc convert one format into other for examplke work to latext 
7	How can we map comfort and all other factors in terms of dolar per seconds considering we don’t have related data?	systemcrafters into emacs the absolute begineers guide emacs 
8	Change reward pics into latex code in dataset	scrobook for dessertation in latex. Download its package 
9	in litertaure review make table papers|rewards|Comments about the function 	
10	Why we need two constants in reward functions? Alpha and beta as in some reward functions?	
11	Can we think of switching cost into surge current or AC life time I mean with a lot of switching the AC gets damaged earlier 	
12	Read ACM E-energy conference papers for a bit more insight about my topic
